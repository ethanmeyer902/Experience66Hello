this remarkable survivor was built in 1857, at a time when Abraham Lincoln was still living in Springfield. Ten years after construction the house was converted to the Ulrich Home for Fallen Women. From 1901 to 1908 it served at the Ambidexter Industrial and Normal Institute for African American Children, modeled on Booker T. Washington's Tuskegee Institute. The house has survived multiple threats. According to the Landmarks Illinois website, “The Springfield Race Riots of 1909, which sparked the formation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), saw the Illinois National Guard protect the Ambidexter Institute from nearby rioters.” It is often described as one of the three most important Black history sites in Springfield. The Springfield Project/Black Chamber of Commerce has taken over management of the site and has received city funding for initial foundation work, which is underway. A community heritage and education center are envisioned. ",NTHP Assessment,,,,,902 S 12th St,Springfield,IL,62703,Sangamon County,1713,,39.7923830057452,-89.6391519855875,171670042001

When I-40 opened two miles south of Seligman in 1978, Angel led the effort to have the state of Arizona make Route 66 a historic highway. In 1987, he helped found the Historic Route 66 Association of Arizona, the first statewide Route 66 association. Shortly thereafter the state of Arizona did designate Route 66 as a historic highway. Angel and his wife Vilma have continued to operate a gift shop on Route 66, and Angel (known as the “Guardian Angel” of Route 66) just retired as a barber in July 2022 at the age of 95 after working for 75 years in the barber trade.

We moved west on Rt66, But the Rt 66 signs that were already gone. We never completed the Route, so my travels started in the west.There are so many memories, happy and sad, of Route 66.  I try to make more each year by traveling it, meeting interesting people, supporting the small businesses, and helping the Route 66 Associations. My photo, of the Meteor City Gilbert Ortega dome, (2018). My first visit (late 70s), it was busy with local crafts and Indian jewelry. The world's longest map of Route 66 stretched to the east. It was featured in the movie Star Man.Later visits resulted in the same stuff from China that you find at everywhere.So much of the Historic Route has deteriorated. Kudos to all those who are stepping up to save what is left! Even if you can't travel to a Route 66 business, they will greatly appreciate your support online.",,,,https://contest.savingplaces.org/2o6eetis,,,Meteor City,AZ,,Coconino County,0402,,35.0943178100001,-110.935198474,040050015003

In an old Chevy Sedan equipped with a window air conditioner and water bag tied to the front we endured the heat of the southwestern deserts in Arizona and New Mexico and would beg to stop at these posts.

Pat was raised in Seligman Arizona and after his time in the Army, wanted to return to his home town to start his family.  Lilo had always dreamed of opening a business on Route 66 and longed to have a place that offered good quality food and some of her German specialties.  In May of 1996, Lilo purchased a restaurant that was closed in the early 80s and with the help of her husband Pat and eldest daughter Nancy, Westside Lilo's Cafe opened for business in June of 1996.  Soon after opening, Lilo's other daughter, Brenda joined the family operation.  Westside Lilo's quickly became a favorite of the locals and many people who travel Historic Route 66 on a regular basis. Lilo's' daily specials, giant cinnamon rolls and carrot cake, continue to drive repeat business, and the restaurant today has quite a following.

While this may not be an old story of Route 66, it is still a wonderful memory of an historic place in our lives.  I retired from full time work in March of 2021 and we moved to Gilbert, Arizona, to be closer to my wife's parents (I call them my in-loves since I am in love with their daughter), since they were now in their 80's and we wanted to be of service to them.  My wife planned a trip for us to the Grand Canyon, about 30 miles north of Williams.  Williams is on Route 66 as the last stop in Arizona going west. My wife booked us a room in the Sheridan Inn, a  Bed and Breakfast in Williams that was absolutely stunning and outstanding in terms of food and lodging and we will stay there again at some point in our lives!  This was my first trip to the Grand Canyon and we took a 45 minute helicopter tour and a walking tour of a few different places in the national park.  I walked around Williams to see the sites and love it.",,,,https://contest.savingplaces.org/4xx9c1wu,,,Williams,AZ,,Coconino County,0402,,35.251054,-112.188636,040050017004

I have been on two great American road trips, both with my best friend. Trips that rival those of Jack Kerouac, or rather, are inspired by life on the road. Route 66 carries our dreams and our memories. Against the asphalt and a painted yellow line, I have learned that the road inspires introspection, authenticity, and laughter. Driving across the United States, while on its most famous road, anyone can feel inspired by their dreams and drive towards them in a very real way. Dreaming along the road with one's best friend is no different -- I couldn't think of a more-preferred trio. Most recently, we drove to Winslow, AZ to stand on a corner like eagles, only to take it easy and indulge in an ice cream cone. However, the road...it calls us, and we traded our stillness for the reality of perpetual motion on the illustrious Route 66.

So, on Friday and Saturday nights at midnight, all the fraternity boys dropped their girls off and headed straight for Bob John's Brandtville for the Trucker's Special. Located on Route 66 on the southeast side of town, late at night the restaurant was a unique mix of over the road drivers, weary travelers and college boys full of themselves. But they all had one thing in common: Bob Johnson's 24-hour-a-day breakfast. Time moved on: Girls' hours ended, boys became men, and some went to Viet Nam.  Brandtville eventually closed and 66 was replaced by 55.

With a rented minivan full of all my possessions, including my cat and dog, I marveled at how vast and endless the roadway seemed against the horizon. At stops along the drive, I would walk each pet for a bit and particularly noted how curious my cat was about this new expansive scenery.Fast forward several days to an overnight stop in Oklahoma, and that curiousity was unstoppable, apparently. Mushi the cat crept unnoticed out of the motel room and into the night, never to been seen again.I like to think of her living the rest of her time along the route, enjoying the space, roaming free.

These ten Caddys range through the ?tail-fin? years, from 1948 to 1964.  It was a nostalgic moment, as I remembered my own 1962 mauve Sedan DeVille (very finny, with all-leather mauve interior!).  I bought it in 1970 for $175, and drove it for a couple of years as it gradually died.  Memorable.  Anyway, Cadillac Ranch is a wonderfully odd work of art.",,,,https://contest.savingplaces.org/wq9fl951,,13651 Frontage Rd,Amarillo,TX,79124,Potter County,4813,,35.18724339,-101.987104518,483750143002

My Dad made a detour to Las Vegas - he was a gambler - but we joined Route 66 again in Kingman.  We took Route 66 most all the way to the Chicago area.  I remember going through Albuquerque, Amarillo - a big dust storm - and Tulsa.  My father took some 8 mm movies, and got a shot of a sign on Route 66, that read ""Flagstaff 27"". He also took a shot of Mt Humphreys and the highway in the distance.  In 2002, my wife and I drove Route 66 from Williams to Oatman, We played various artists singing ""Get Your Kicks on Route 66.""  What else?  We took a detour to Interstate 40, and found a sign that said ""Flagstaff 28"".  Close enough.  The road was changed; the forest had changed; but Mt Humphreys was in the same place.  It was great to be near the spot my Dad had filmed, 50 years earlier.  When we got back to Tempe, I dubbed Natalie Cole singing Route 66 to the videos we shot.",Share Your Story: Bob Marshak,,Bob Marshak,https://contest.savingplaces.org/hf1suqkp,,,Oatman,AZ,,Mohave County,0409,,35.026807,-114.384118,040159548022

With a population of 87, it's a unique small town stop where Route 66 travelers can stretch their legs, explore an old west town, mail postcards to friends, and stock up on water and souvenirs. Wild burros roam Main Street, seeking food from locals and travelers. Feeding the burrows is strictly prohibited, but their presence adds to the town's appeal. Note: Mind the burro droppings and urine. Bonus. Depending on your arrival time, if you're not busy perusing the historic buildings, keep an eye out for a good old-fashioned Wild West faux shootout in the middle of Main Street.

This was my second trip from my hometown Dwight, IL all the way to the Missouri border in Madison. I had seen a picture of the Chain of Rocks bridge from a different angle and I found a way to give that a try. I went to the Mississippi River shore and learned two lessons. One, do not go down to the muddy Mississippi after a day of rain. Two, do not wear flip-flops in said mud. I ended up getting stuck in the mud but ended up taking this picture in that very spot, so being stuck was very much worth it. Having feet coated in mud also gave me the advantage of not having small rocks poke me on the way back to my car. I ended up capturing a gorgeous sunset as well on the way back home.",Share Your Story: Elisabeth Lowe,,Elisabeth Lowe,https://contest.savingplaces.org/u54p24b6,,,Saint Louis,MO,,St. Louis city,2901,,38.7601741940001,-90.175133547,295101270001

Along 66, we visited the Launching Pad, Funk's Grove for Sirup, ate at the Ariston, and ended up at the Chain of Rocks Bridge along the Mother Road in Illinois. Inspiration and photos were used for my albums, Rivers of Asphalt and The Father Road. I wanted to express my feelings of a lost era throughout both albums, but not a nostalgic take, something closer to Kraftwerk meets Pink Floyd. Bob Waldmire was interested in my project and provided him some of the music to inspire his planned cover art, which he loved, but he sadly passed before I finished the record. We ended up using a shot from the Chain of Rocks Bridge for the cover. Nevertheless, receiving a surprise phone call from Bob remains one of the highlights of my life. Rivers of Asphalt was dedicated to Bob and my parents in the liner notes for the album.",Share Your Story: Paul Williams,,Paul Williams,https://contest.savingplaces.org/15zhlxca,,Chain of Rocks Bridge,St. Louis,MO,,St. Louis city,2901,,38.7601741940001,-90.175133547,295101270001

Our table was by the fireplace, and as it was January and quite cold in Illinois, it was worth snapping a picture of the moment.",Share Your Story: Elisabeth Lowe,,Elisabeth Lowe,https://contest.savingplaces.org/6hkykzxn,,645 Joliet Rd,Willowbrook,IL,60527,DuPage County,1706,,41.7455625520001,-87.93923246,170438459021

Louise Brown was born and raised in Seligman, AZ. In Seligman, AZ, Louise Brown ran the famous diner, the Copper Cart Restaurant. She witnessed the changes that came with the highway and remained optimistic. However, the construction of a bypass on the highway eventually caused her diner to suffer. Despite this, Louise kept her diner running for many years, preserving the spirit of Route 66 and her love for her hometown.After raising five children, she made the difficult decision to sell the restaurant. Thanks to the efforts of many residents surrounding Route 66, more and more travelers are now visiting these small towns and revitalizing Route 66. Route 66 represents a time when things were simpler, with a small town atmosphere and way of life. Seligman, is a charming little town that embodies all the wonderful things about small town living - love, friendship, and a community that values neighbors.",,,,https://contest.savingplaces.org/w2eih47c,,22385 W Old Highway 66,Seligman,AZ,86337,Yavapai County,0402,,35.3264694335476,-112.875819204467,040250021003

The motel initially consisted of separate cabins, but as the business continued to grow the gaps between the cabins were filled in to create more units. In 1957, Route 66 was rerouted bypassing the motel. As a result, Pete Hudson, the owner, built a makeshift bridge over a ditch to provide travelers easy access to the motel from the new alignment of Route 66. The motel's iconic sign, which has welcomed guests for decades, was restored with the assistance of The Neon Heritage Preservation Committee, The Route 66 Association of Missouri and The National Park Service.",,,,https://contest.savingplaces.org/dzzyemns,,1336 U.S. Rte 66,Lebanon,MO,65536,Laclede County,2904,,37.6858410042179,-92.63970601961,291059605002

Old Riverton Store, has been a gathering place for nearby residents and a popular stop for Route 66 travelers. The business was established in 1925 after its owner, WWI veteran Leo Williams constructed the building. Although the store has changed hands multiple times it has continually operated as a market offering a variety of goods such as produce, flowers, local crafts, and Route 66 memorabilia. The store's interior has remained largely unchanged, with many original features still intact, including its pressed ceiling tiles and deli counter. Recognizing its historical significance, the distinctive vernacular building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

When I was born in 1954, the 'Bigs' lived in Norman, Oklahoma, and owned a neighborhood store, Tadlock Grocery. Within a week of my birth at Chanute AFB, Rantoul, Illinois, the Bigs drove over 700 miles in one day, on the Mother Road to come see me. Stopping for gas outside St. Louis, Missouri, Big Momma fell in love with a little clock on sale at a gas station. The clock was fashioned as a cottage with a big picture window and a little gray-haired lady with a bun, sitting in a rocking chair. That beloved clock sat on their fireplace mantel for as long as I can remember, mesmerizing generations of small children. As a nomadic military family, our yearly pilgrimage to the Bigs felt like coming home and although I do not remember that first meeting, every time I look at my Rock'n Granny clock, I remember the loving warmth of my Grandparent?s happy home.

He got a job at the Texaco station located on Route 66 which was attached to Steve?s Café. Willie worked 10 pm to 7 am 7 days a week for $35. He met Norma Kiper shortly after taking that job. She used get gas just to see Willie; and he would ?clean the windshield profusely while trying to charm her?. They will celebrate their 73rd anniversary June 19, 2024.Willie recalls that one night in 1949 while he was working waitresses from Steve?s Café came into the station saying there was trouble and needed his help. He ran into the café and found that a man had the owner, Steve Wilcox, up against the wall in the kitchen area with a butcher knife to his throat. Willie talked continuously to the guy to try to stall for awhile. Police officer, Jerry Gillespie, showed up and told the man, who obviously had been drinking, to put the knife down, and he did. Mr. Wilcox always thanked Willie for saving his life.

The restaurant's old Facebook page was active as recently as 2024, but the website below notes that the City of Countryside Municipal Complex was built with a LEED certification, making it unlikely that the city government simply took over the old restaurant building. I suspect it is a new build.

The property features a cafe and station where guests could enjoy meals and refuel their vehicles before embarking on their journey to experience more of Route 66. Buildings original to the property were constructed with local Ozark sandstone and reflect the Tudor Revival style. During the 1940s, the iconic Wagon Wheel neon sign that welcomes travelers was erected. In 2003, the motel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and today the former gas station and cafe house the gift shop.

Over the past 7 years when we've told people about our honeymoon they always say it sounds so ""us,"" and countless people have told us how they've dreamed of a similar trip. I have so many fond memories from the trip, so Route 66 makes me think of being hopeful and in love.

Of course, snatching samples of the beautiful fossils is strictly forbidden. But tourists can readily find all the petrified wood they could want at commercial shops both inside and outside the park boundaries. These establishments obtain quantities of the material from deposits on private lands. They can supply rough chunks for landscaping or decorating, as well as beautifully cut and polished jewelry and souvenir items of smaller scale. We found this lumber yard just south of Holbrook, Arizona, in 2010. It had acres of natural specimens outside and a shop with more varied offerings inside.

However, with the construction of the I-40 highway bypassing the town of Williams in the 1970s, the hotel fell into disrepair, mirroring the decline of the once-thriving town. In 2004, the town council mandated the sale of the hotel, prompting substantial investments to restore its former splendor. Under new ownership, the hotel has undergone another meticulous renovation, seamlessly blending timeless Victorian aesthetics with modern amenities to offer guests an immersive historic experience.

In 1891, the Funks began commercially producing maple syrup and to this day the business continues to be owned by the Funk family.

Sure, the radio and lights aren't original, but there are none of the modern distractions that make it so easy to ignore what's around you. It's obvious that the restoration of the motel had been thoughtfully done in an effort to truly recreate the experience of a 1949 traveler. Our room had a radio but not a TV. Why? Because the town of Carthage didn't get television until 1953. Was the bed the most comfortable we've ever slept in? No, but that doesn't matter when you open the door with an actual key or pull up the era-appropriate chenille bedspread. The best part of our stay, however, was the evening, which we spent playing gin rummy and sipping wine from plastic cups while listening to '40s tunes.

Casas de Suenos is an absolutely wonderful assemblage of studio to 2BR Casitas set in a beautiful garden setting. Originally built approx 1930s as an artist enclave, it is a wonderful National Historic Register property that deserves a visit even if time or availability doesn't allow a stay over.

I've had the pleasure of showing my historic women's history documentaries here, including The Harvey Girls: Opportunity Bound and Route 66: The Untold Story of Women on the Mother Road.  The 1928 theatre is the only example of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture in Gallup. It was designed by Carl Boller of the Boller Brothers architecture firm of Los Angeles and Kansas City. The Boller Brothers firm was responsible for designing many theaters in the Southwest, Midwest and California. Once described as a ""castle of pleasure and art"", the El Morro occupies a prominent location on Coal Avenue and has been the backdrop to many Indian Tribal Ceremonial parades.  Featured in this photo is Harvey Girl Virginia Tellez Wayne and her son Michael.  Virgina worked at the El Navajo Harvey House in Gallup, New Mexico and at many other Route 66 restaurants.

Visitors stepping into the historically accurate lobby will be transported to former waiting rooms where they can view carefully curated exhibits, grouped topically, sharing the history of early Bristow and Oklahoma: the dirt road that would later become Route 66, the foot racers of the 1928 Bunion Derby, the days of hidden moonshine, the starkness of segregation, and train departures of our hometown military members during World War I, Korea, and continuing through Vietnam. Families will love the caboose outside and depot plaza with picnic tables and plenty of room for the kids to run. We share our history so that we can learn from the lessons of the past.

Like so many other Route 66 businesses, it struggled to survive the COVID years, only to recently face the challenge of updating an obsolete grease fire protection exhaust system. Fortunately, its owner, Almead Stutt, learned of the Route 66 Road Ahead Partnership's Route 66 Extraordinary Women Micro-Grant Program, applied, and received a grant award in 2023 to help replace her exhaust system. As a recent customer noted, Absolutely amazing. My son and I stopped in today and we were not disappointed.

Located in the northeast corner of Oklahoma, the structure originally operated as a Marathon gas station, opening shortly after Route 66 arrived in town in 1926. Retro gas pumps remind us of the adorable red and white building's original function. However, the Mother Road is not the only famous presence in Commerce. Bonnie and Clyde made an infamous visit in 1934, and Mickey Mantle's childhood home is just a few blocks away. The Dairy King is a hallmark of Americana in Commerce. Ice cream was first sold on site in the 1950s, and the Dairy King?s soft serve still beckons Route 66 travelers and local residents. The restaurant, owned and operated in its current form by Treva and Charles Duboise, is also known for its burgers and Route 66 cookies, shaped and decorated in the form of the Route 66 shield.

The trip changed the trajectory of my life, cementing a passion for roadside architecture and providing the underpinnings of a career in a field I wouldn't properly discover existed for another few years - historic preservation. I've since gotten a Master's degree in preservation (where I did a thesis on neon sign preservation), run a preservation advocacy organization in a major American city, and served on the board of a national roadside architecture preservation organization. And it really started with this trip. Every stop was as intriguing as the next, but the most surprising was California's Mojave Desert, that vast expanse that too many miss because they drive through at night or are told there's nothing there.
